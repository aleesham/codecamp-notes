# Scratch Notes


## HTML elements 

- `<b></b>` - the bold tab, -inline
- `<em></em>` - the italicized tab, -inline
- `<img src="" alt=""/>` - the image tab. It has attributes src and alt. src is a url where the image can be found and alt is text that gets displayed if the image breaks. Note that because the img has no content, it does not have an end tag. This is an example of a void tag. -inline
- `<br>` - the break tag; this tag is a void tag. It breaks a line. -inline
- `<p></p>` - the paragraph tag -This is a block and creates an invisible box. 
-`<span></span>`-inline
-`<div></div>` -block
- `<span>` and `<div>` are the almost same thing with attribute class, which refers to CSS
- `<tag attr="value">contents</tag>`
Example: anchors are for making links. href is its attribute
`<a href="www.reddit.com">derp</a>`

## HTML Documents
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    content
</body>
</html>
```

The head includes meta-data, title, JS, CSS, etc.
The body includes actual contents of the document, the stuff you see on the screen.
